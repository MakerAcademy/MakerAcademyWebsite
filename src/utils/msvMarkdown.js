#### Mission

Maker Academy increases the proficiency of current/potential MakerDAO contributors and justifies the public adoption of MakerDAO's products by facilitating the production of expert-curated content.


#### Vision

Maker Academy will strive to be the go-to source of education regarding MakerDAO. Learners of MakerDAO need no longer be presented with a conflicting, fragmented, and unorganized body of information.


###### Highest Quality Content

• The educational content produced by Maker Academy will be regarded as the most trusted source of information by core units and the DeFi community as a whole.\n
• The content will have the widest impact since there will be content tailored for all relevant audiences.\n
• Exceptionally clear and concise content, accomplished by following the highest standards of communication and pedagogy, will allow users to rapidly grow their knowledge and compress their learning curve.

###### Assistance in Onboarding Pipelines

• Maker Academy will leverage its active community of MakerDAO learners to create a funnel into the onboarding process for the incubation program, core unit teams, the grants program, and other ways of contribution towards MakerDAO.\n
• Through working with core units to establish onboarding material, Maker Academy will rapidly turn new hires into contributors that are integrated with their team and work.

###### Identification & Allocation of Work

• Through the continuous analysis of MakerDAO required to produce educational content, Maker Academy will be a large source of producing research questions for all kinds of contributors to investigate.\n
• Maker Academy will assist core units with their work by formatting it into clearly defined projects, such as bounties or grant projects, that Maker Academy's learners can complete as a part of their education. 

###### Unification of Information
• Maker Academy will encourage knowledge sharing amongst the core units in order to aggregate their documentation, new discoveries, and other relevant information in one easy to find place.


#### Strategy
Maker Academy's vision has many facets—all centered around educating various audiences about MakerDAO. In order to be scalable, Maker Academy will not produce this content by itself, but rather facilitate the educational relationship between learners and experts. To accomplish this, Maker Academy will build and maintain an educational platform that incentivizes learners to learn and experts to produce content. However, even though experts are knowledgeable about their domain, teaching/communicating their domain requires a different expertise. Maker Academy's team of pedagogists/communicators provide this expertise. Additionally, the Maker Academy team will use this expertise to structure the experts' content into curricula for the learners, giving them a streamlined path to their educational goals.

Although content will be developed for all relevant audiences, the Maker Academy Team will cater to certain audiences that benefit MakerDAO the most, by ensuring that the relevant educational content is produced for these audiences. To start with, Maker Academy has selected MakerDAO contributors as the first audience to ensure educational content is created for. This audience can be broken down into many subunits, the main ones being new core units, current core unit team members, grantees, and delegates.

##### Educational Platform
Maker Academy will use a website as its educational platform. However, in the future, this could evolve to more presentation mediums.

###### Incentives

When core units develop onboarding material with the help of the Maker Academy Team, they will receive a direct benefit—more knowledgeable new hires. However, besides this instance, most experts will not receive any benefits (besides recognition) when communicating their knowledge. To fix this problem, Maker Academy will continuously explore different incentives for experts. Maker Academy will potentially start by trial-running a monetary incentive—giving DAI to experts for producing content.
	
Maker Academy will incentivize learners to join our platform by clearly demonstrating the path from learning to contributing and making it highly accessible.

###### Quality-Control

A high quality of educational content will be incentivized by the Maker Academy Team. We initially plan to very thoroughly review all educational content posted by external content creators in order to set an example for the sight. Afterwards, we plan on reviewing content to the extent that Maker Academy has time, always ensuring that content is at least appropriate. To incentivize high quality content, we will tag content that passes Maker Academy standards and prioritize that content to the reader and possibly offer other rewards as well.

###### Content Structure
Most education will be implemented through courses. Courses have the advantage of being able to increase an audience's knowledge to a great extent, as opposed to an article, conference, tweet, etc. Courses will vary in level of depth. If an audience's motivation does not require a low-level understanding of some process, then a high-level description will be given, and vice-versa. For example, an audience motivated to understand the budgeting of MakerDAO will need to know how governance works, but will not need to understand how it is implemented through smart contracts. This structure will be planned and implemented by the Maker Academy Team.

Additionally, Maker Academy plans to offer certificates for the completion of different programs. These programs will contain a sequential ordering of content that takes the user from some base level of knowledge to achieving a high enough understanding to make some kind of contribution.

###### Success Metrics
Maker Academy's platform plans to keep track of and store all kinds of different analytics. Some of these metrics may not be used in any kind of success measurement, but they could be in the future. To start, we plan to measure the success of the platform itself by measuring trends in the amount of users, amount of content produced, and amount of content consumed. Additionally, we also plan on having an optional questionnaire users can submit in order to review the platform.

###### Onboarding Educational Content
The Maker Academy Team will analyze each core unit, determining which topics are needed to be understood in order to be a successful employee. Then, outlines of reusable courses will be constructed and communicated to the core units. Then, experts (most likely the core units) will produce the material with the help of the Maker Academy Team. The onboarding material will be available to current core unit members, new hires, and future hires. 

###### Success Metrics
Since the educational platform's success metrics already track participation/involvement, success metrics for onboarding material will be based on the effectiveness of the education. Maker Academy plans to assist with the onboarding pipeline and keep track of users throughout the learning and contribution process. The turnover rates will be a major success metric.
